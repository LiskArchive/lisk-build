# Lisk Build

A binary package building tool for [Lisk](https://lisk.io/). Allows automated compilation of binary packages, with support for multiple posix-based operating systems.

Please read [Installing Lisk (from Binaries)](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-docs/blob/master/BinaryInstall.md) if you are merely looking to install Lisk onto an already supported operating system / architecture.

## Platforms

- [Linux (native)](#linux)
- [Darwin (native)](#darwin)

**NOTE:** For each platform, the resulting packages are placed within the `src` directory, using the following naming convention: `lisk-{version}-{os}-{architecture}.tar.gz`.

## Linux

To build a package, perform the following on a machine matching your target architecture (e.g x86_64 or i686), that has a Debian/Ubuntu based operating system installed.

1. Install `git` and `sudo`:

  ```
  sudo apt-get install git sudo
  ```

2. Clone repository:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-build.git
  ```

3. Change into `lisk-build` directory:

  ```
  cd lisk-build
  ```

4. Install build toolchain:

  ```
  bash toolchains/install_linux.sh
  ```

5. Build package - Replace `NETWORK` with `test` or `main`, replace `VERSION` with specific version.

  ```
  bash build.sh -n NETWORK -v VERSION
  ```

## Darwin

1. Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) developer tools:

  ```
  https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
  ```

2. Clone repository:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-build.git
  ```

3. Change into `lisk-build` directory:

  ```
  cd lisk-build
  ```

4. Install build toolchain:

  ```
  bash toolchains/install_darwin.sh
  ```

5. Build package - Replace `NETWORK` with `test` or `main`, replace `VERSION` with specific version.
